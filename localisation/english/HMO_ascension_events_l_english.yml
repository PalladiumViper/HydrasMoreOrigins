New studies conducted on the influence of the synthesization process on the mind has uncovered a disturbing discovery: Those who contracted the disease, but were either immune or was transfered into a synthetic body in time have abnormal subprocesses running as part of their personality matrix.\n\nThe news of this has caused fear that the plague did not fully die when we transfered our minds to our new bodies, but instead adapted and could erupt into a new pandemic at any time.\n\nWhile these fears are unfounded, the effect it has on our population is noticable, and many officials call for the strenghening of our digital security, or even the extreme option of completely severing any over-the-air connections from and to our synthetic bodies."
