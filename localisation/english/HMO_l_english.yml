# start screen messages
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_PURIFIERS: "A long time ago, our empire was grand. One of the mightiest the galaxy had ever seen. Our goal was to exterminate all other sapient lifeforms, something we almost succeeded in. However, those we hunted banded together in a final attempt at survival, and we were beaten back before being imprisoned in our homeworld by a shield meant to last for the rest of eternity."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_SWARM: "A long time ago, our consciousness stretched across most of the galaxy. We had but one singular purpose: To devour all other lifeforms. Our prey, however, were smart, and they banded together and drove us back, taking much of our territory. By using a weapon capable of generating impervious shields, they sealed us in our home, left to rot for eternity."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_EXTERMINATORS: "A long time ago, we were on the brink of achieving our goal: the destruction of all organic life. Only a few pockets of resistance was left, and it wouldn't take long before they too would have been destroyed. However, our calculations had not been correct, and by some statistical improbability, the organic lifeforms manage to defeat us. They sealed our main processing core and billions of drones on the planet of our creators behind an impenetrable shield."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_PURIFIERS_PART_TWO: "Our society eventually fell into ruins, as did our homeworld due to the sudden and unexpected cutoff from the rest of the galaxy. Much technology was lost during our time behind the shield. However, recently, the shield has started to deteriorate, letting us breach it and finally setting our people free."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_SWARM_PART_TWO: "Eventually, all that was left on our homeworld was the mind and our drones. We would not have survived if it was not for the cracks in the shield, allowing us to break free. Though we had lost much knowdledge because of the sudden cut-off from most of our drones, we managed to break the shield."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_EXTERMINATORS_PART_TWO: "Eventually, our sensors picked up irregularities. The shield had been flawed, or perhaps it was never meant to last forever. We acted swiftly and broke the shield, allowing us to once again access the wider galaxy."
 START_SCREEN_BANISHED_HMO_PURIFIERS_PART_THREE: "Now, with the re-descovery of the hyperdrive we can finally fullfill our destiny of galactic purity!"

Life being sealed away is one of temporal uncertainty, not only because of the prolonged isolation, but also because of the effects the energy barrier has on the timestream.\n\nWith such crucial knowledge as the time disrepancy between our downfall and now, it is imperative to figure out how long it has been.
