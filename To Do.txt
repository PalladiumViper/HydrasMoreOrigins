- Finish the rest of the authority icons

- Martial Law Ruler Localization

- Save ruler upon creating empire, make commander leader and assign it to country scope, then if martial law is not kept, create the saved leader and reassign it on country scope during the 15xx events. Remember to destroy saved leader if not used, so no memory leak. Leader should get skill levels equal to the commander leader that held the position until then.
- Remember to make concept for the above and include it in the tooltip.

- Cybernetic Situation Event Weight

- Remake the intro event

- Make some event or include in existing event the liberation of cities (automatically clear zombie town blockers)

Zombie attacks

Random zombie attacks (Stops once you pick an ascension path)

Overwrite of Psionic and Genetic ascension perks

Insurgency convert some events into toasts or one-time-events-that-then-become-toasts (Remember to copy to Forgotten History)
- Liberating a planet from the insurgency is now a toast

- After The Apocalypse More Zombie Blockers (Especially for HMO_origin.7010)

- Cybernetic Zombie Authorities give the zombie strain bombardment stance which spawn zombie armies when pops are killed. Contrary to the zombie armies on the homeworld, these stay when the original army is defeated (They are of the zombie plague country type, so the bombarder will have to kill them to get the planet.)

	For Wildworld, decrease initial pops and add a planetary modifier called
	
#Make special projects pop up from time to time that allow you to attack zombies (Possibly: Delete all defending armies first, that way an attack on the zombies can be simulated with army transports)
#On completing the special projects, the armies in orbit that did the project land (if possible) and zombie armies are spawned.
#Then if zombies lose, delete the targeted deposit (Is targeted from project creation to make it make sense that they are picking a specific target. Farm deposits spawn less zombies, cities more etc.)
#If zombies win, do nothing except delete the zombie armies

# Description #

Are you searching for more origins?
Do you want more variety when creating your empire?
Or perhaps you just want more ways to start on a tomb world?

If you answered yes to any of those questions, then you have come to the right place!
In Hydra's More Origins you will find 9 new and old modded origins, all painstakingly crafted by yours truly!
The origins are a mix of different types, including some made for roleplay, others for those who like a good story origin, and lets not forget the fun new strategies you may or may not be able to use!
The length of the origins and their mechanical complexity vary greatly, but all have been made the best I can, with a focus on staying true to the vanilla feel of an unmodded game. That is to say, I tried to make these in line with vanilla origins.
All of the origins have a unique icons and come with concepts (blue text that makes popups).
3 of the origins come from another mod of mine, Forgotten History, though they have recieved updates so they are up to par with the rest of the origins in this mod.

[h3] Translations [/h3]

[h3] Overwrites [/h3]
This mod overwrites the Psionic and Genetic ascension perks, as well as the has_ascension_situation_ongoing scripted trigger.

[h3] Inbuilt Compatibility [/h3]
Ethics and Civics: Bug Branch
After The Apocalypse is intended to work with the authorities from Bug Branch, and while most of the code/script is already done, I still need to write all the localisation.
Forgotten History
You can safely enable both this mod and Forgotten History. I have made sure no origins are duplicated if both are active at the same time.

[h3] Thanks To [/h3]
Special Thanks to TrueWolves who designed the Born of Necessity and Wildworld origins.
Also special thanks to Azurian for helping me refine origin ideas, as well as MaxiundMicky for providing feedback during development.
